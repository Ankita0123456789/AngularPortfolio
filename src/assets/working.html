<h1 style="text-align: center;color: teal;">Working Portfolios</h1>
   <p> A working portfolio is so named because it is a project “in the works,” 
    containing work in progress as well as finished samples of work. 
    It serves as a holding tank for work that may be selected later for a
     more permanent assessment or display portfolio.</p>
    
    A working portfolio is different from a work folder, 
    which is simply a receptacle for all work, with no purpose to the collection.
     A working portfolio is an intentional collection of work guided by learning objectives.
    
    <h1 style="text-align: center;color: teal;">Purpose</h1>
    <p>The major purpose of a working portfolio is to serve as a holding tank 
    for student work. The pieces related to a specific topic are collected 
    here until they move to an assessment portfolio or a display portfolio, 
    or go home with the student. In addition, the working portfolio may be used
     to diagnose student needs. Here both student and teacher have evidence of 
     student strengths and weaknesses in achieving learning objectives, information 
     extremely useful in designing future instruction.</p>
    
    <h1 style="text-align: center;color: teal;">Audience</h1>
   <p> Given its use in diagnosis, the primary audience for a working portfolio is 
    the student, with guidance from the teacher. By working on the portfolio and
     reflecting on the quality of work contained there, the student becomes more
      reflective and self-directed. With very young children, however, the primary 
      audience is the teacher, with the participation of the student.</p>
    
    Parents may be another important audience of a working portfolio, since it
     can help inform parent/teacher conferences. The portfolio is particularly 
     useful for those parents who do not accept the limitations of their child's 
     current skills or do not have a realistic picture of the way their child is 
     progressing compared with other children. In such situations, evidence from
      a portfolio can truly “speak a thousand words.” In addition, a portfolio can
       serve to document the progress a student has made, progress of which a parent may be unaware.
    
    <h1 style="text-align: center;color: teal;">Process</h1>
    <p>A working portfolio is typically structured around a specific content area; 
    pieces collected relate to the objectives of that unit and document student
     progress toward mastery of those objectives. Therefore, sufficient work must
      be collected to provide ample evidence of student achievement. Because diagnosis 
      is a major purpose of the working portfolio, some of the pieces included will show 
      less than complete understanding and will help shape future instruction.
    
    The working portfolio is reviewed as a whole and its pieces evaluated—either
     periodically or at the end of the learning unit. Some pieces may be shifted
      to an assessment portfolio to document student acquisition of instructional 
      objectives. Other pieces may be moved to a student's own display (or best works) 
      portfolio or celebration of individual learning. Still other pieces are sent home 
      with the student.
    
    As students move pieces from a working portfolio into either an assessment or
     display portfolio, they describe the reasons for their choices. In this process 
     of selection and description, students must reflect seriously on their work and 
     what it demonstrates about them as learners. As students and their teachers look
      through the portfolio, they set short-term objectives for achieving certain
       curriculum goals. The portfolio thus provides evidence of strengths and 
       weaknesses and serves to define the next steps in learning.</p>
