<h1 style="text-align: center;color: teal;">Display, Showcase, or Best Works Portfolios</h1>
<p>Probably the most rewarding use of student portfolios is the display 
of the students' best work, the work that makes them proud. Students, 
as well as their teachers, become most committed to the process when they 
experience the joy of exhibiting their best work and interpreting its meaning.
 Many educators who do not use portfolios for any other purpose engage their
  students in the creation of display portfolios. The pride and sense of 
  accomplishment that students feel make the effort well worthwhile and 
  contribute to a culture for learning in the classroom.</p>

  <h1 style="text-align: center;color: teal;">Purpose</h1>
<p>The purpose of a display portfolio is to demonstrate the highest level 
of achievement attained by the student. Collecting items for this portfolio
 is a student's way of saying “Here's who I am. Here is what I can do.”

A display portfolio may be maintained from year to year, with new pieces 
added each year, documenting growth over time. And while a best works portfolio 
may document student efforts with respect to curriculum objectives, it may also
 include evidence of student activities beyond school (a story written at home, for example).

There are many possibilities for the contents of a display portfolio. 
The benefits of portfolios were first recognized in the area of language arts,
 specifically in writing. Therefore, writing portfolios are the most widely
  known and used. But students may elect to put many types of items in their 
  portfolio of best works—a drawing they like, a poem they have written, 
  a list of books they have read, or a difficult problem they have solved.</p>

  <h1 style="text-align: center;color: teal;">Audience</h1>
<p>Since the student selects her or his own best works, the audience for a 
display portfolio is that student and the other important individuals, 
such as parents and older siblings, to whom the student chooses to show
 the portfolio. Other audiences include a current teacher or next year's 
 teacher, who may learn a lot about the student by studying the portfolio.

In addition, a student may submit portfolios of best works to colleges or 
potential employers to supplement other information; art students have 
always used this approach. The contents of these portfolios are determined 
by the interests of the audience and may include videos, written work,
 projects, resumés, and testimonials. The act of assembling a display 
 portfolio for such a practical purpose can motivate high school students
  to produce work of high quality.</p>

  <h1 style="text-align: center;color: teal;">Process</h1>
<p>Most pieces for a display portfolio are collected in a working portfolio 
of school projects. Sometimes, however, a student will include a piece of 
work from outside the classroom, such as a project from scouts or a poem 
written at home. Students select the items to be included in a display portfolio.
 Their choices define them as students and as learners. In making their selections, 
 students illustrate what they believe to be important about their learning, 
 what they value and want to show to others.</p>
