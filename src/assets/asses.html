The primary function of an assessment portfolio is to document what a student 
has learned. The content of the curriculum, then, will determine what students 
select for their portfolios. Their reflective comments will focus on the extent 
to which they believe the portfolio entries demonstrate their mastery of the 
curriculum objectives.</div>
<div  class="col-xl-5 col-md-8">
 For example, if the curriculum specifies persuasive, narrative, 
and descriptive writing, an assessment portfolio should include examples of each type of 
writing. Similarly, if the curriculum calls for mathematical problem solving and 
mathematical communication, then the display portfolio will include entries documenting 
both problem solving and communication, possibly in the same entry.</div>

<h1 style="text-align: center;color: teal;">Purpose</h1>
<op>The primary purpose of an assessment portfolio is to document student learning on 
specific curriculum outcomes. As such, the items in the portfolio must be designed 
to elicit the knowledge and skill specified in the outcomes. It is the assessment 
tasks that bring the curriculum outcomes to life; only by specifying precisely what 
students must do and how well they must do it do these statements of learning have meaning.

Assessment portfolios may be used to demonstrate mastery in any curricular area. 
They may span any period of time, from one unit to the entire year. And they may be
 dedicated to one subject or many subjects. For example, a teacher may wish to have
  evidence that a child has sufficient skills in a content area to move to the next
   level or grade. The criteria for moving on and the types of necessary evidence 
   must be established. Then the portfolio is compiled and assessed.</p>

   <h1 style="text-align: center;color: teal;">Audience</h1>
<p>There are many possible audiences for an assessment portfolio, depending on its 
specific purpose. One audience may be the classroom teacher, who may become 
convinced that the objectives of an instructional unit have been mastered or 
who may decide to place a student in advanced classes or special sections.
 Alternatively, the audience may be the school district or even the state, 
 seeking documentation of student learning, and permitting a student to move
  to the high school or receive a diploma. A secondary, though very important, 
  audience is always the student, who provides evidence of significant learning.
</p>
  <h1 style="text-align: center;color: teal;">Process</h1>
<p>There are eight basic steps in developing an assessment portfolio system. 
Since portfolio entries represent a type of performance, these steps resemble
 the principles for developing good performance assessments.

Determine the curricular objectives to be addressed through the portfolio.
Determine the decisions that will be made based on the portfolio assessments.
 Will the assessments be used for high-stakes assessment at certain 
 levels of schooling (for example, to enable students to make the transition
  from middle school to high school)?
Design assessment tasks for the curricular objectives. Ensure that the task matches 
instructional intentions and adequately represents the content and skills 
(including the appropriate level of difficulty) students are expected to attain. 
These considerations will ensure the validity of the assessment tasks.
Define the criteria for each assessment task and establish performance standards for each criterion.
Determine who will evaluate the portfolio entries. Will they be teachers 
from the students' own school? Teachers from another school? Or does the state identify and train evaluators?
Train teachers or other evaluators to score the assessments. This will ensure the reliability of the assessments.
Teach the curriculum, administer assessments, collect them in portfolios, score assessments.
As determined in Step 2, make decisions based on the assessments in the portfolios.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: teal;">Challenges</h1>
<p>Assessment portfolios raise many important practical and technical issues, 
particularly if they are used for high-stakes decisions. Portfolios can be 
used to establish that students have mastered the essential elements of the
 curriculum, and high school graduation can be contingent on demonstrating 
 this mastery. In cases like this, it is essential that the procedures used to evaluate
  student work in the portfolio meet standards of validity and reliability.

How will student products be evaluated if student writing or mathematical problem solving 
is included in the portfolio? How will practitioners be sure that the products are
 good enough, that the work is of high quality? By what criteria will student work
  be judged? To answer these questions, educators develop scoring guides, or rubrics,
   with clear criteria and descriptions of different levels of performance. And 
   to ensure inter-rater agreement, they collect samples of student work at the 
   different levels (called anchor papers) and conduct training sessions for assessors.

But even in a classroom environment where the stakes are lower, assessment
 portfolios are more formal affairs than those designed to diagnose 
 learning needs (working portfolios) or to celebrate learning (best works portfolios).
  In an assessment portfolio, the content matters and it must demonstrate and document
   what students have learned. The origin of an assessment portfolio may be quite 
   external to the student and his world. The mandate may come from outside the 
   classroom—for instance, via curriculum committees and board action, or directly 
   from the state department of education. Moreover, the eventual owner of the 
   portfolio's contents may be someone other than the student. In addition, 
   the selection process is more controlled and dictated, since the portfolio 
   entries must document particular learning outcomes. And there may be no 
   opportunity for the student to “show off” his or her portfolio.</p>
